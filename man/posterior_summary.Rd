\title{Posterior Summary for Model Fit}
\usage{
posterior_summary(fit, cred_mass = 0.95, keep_fit = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A fitted model object containing model_data and sample_list as
returned by the model fitting procedure.}

\item{cred_mass}{Numeric. The mass of the credible interval (default: 0.95).}

\item{keep_fit}{Logical. If TRUE, the original fit object is
included in the output (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{prob_summ_df}{A data frame with posterior mean and credible
interval for probabilities, by time and class.}
\item{model_data}{The model data object used for fitting.}
\item{nw_sample}{Number of unique classes sampled at each iteration.}
\item{posterior_mean}{List with posterior means for lambda and alpha.}
}
If keep_fit = TRUE, the original fit object is also included.
}
\description{
Compute posterior summaries (mean and credible intervals) for estimated
probabilities and latent class assignments from a fitted model object.
}
\details{
This function extracts posterior samples from the fitted model, calculates the
posterior mean and highest density intervals (HDI) for probabilities,
and summarizes the latent class assignments.
The summary is returned as a data frame along with class assignment
estimates and other relevant information. Posterior means for lambda and
alpha are also included if available.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assume 'fit' is a fitted model object returned by your fitting function
summary <- posterior_summary(fit, cred_mass = 0.9)
head(summary$prob_summ_df)
