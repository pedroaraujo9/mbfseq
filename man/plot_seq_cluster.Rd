\usage{
plot_seq_cluster(
  fit = NULL,
  G = NULL,
  M = NULL,
  z = NULL,
  w = NULL,
  id = NULL,
  time = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{Optional. Output from fit_mbfseq. If provided, extracts clustering assignments and metadata for plotting.}

\item{G}{Optional. Number of clusters (G). Used to select the model from fit if fit is provided.}

\item{M}{Optional. Number of mixture components (M). Used to select the model from fit if fit is provided.}

\item{z}{Optional. Sequence cluster assignments. Used if fit is not provided.}

\item{w}{Optional. Cluster labels for each sequence. Used if fit is not provided.}

\item{id}{Vector of subject or sequence identifiers. Used if fit is not provided.}

\item{time}{Vector of time points for each observation. Used if fit is not provided.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing a heatmap of sequence clusters over time, with cluster boundaries marked in red.
}
\description{
Visualize the sequence clustering results as a heatmap, with cluster boundaries highlighted. Accepts either a fitted model object or raw clustering assignments.
}
\details{
If a fitted model object is provided, the function extracts cluster assignments and metadata automatically. Otherwise, provide z, w, id, and time directly.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Using a fitted model:
plot_seq_cluster(fit = result, G = 2, M = 4)

# Using raw assignments:
plot_seq_cluster(z = z, w = w, id = id, time = time)
}
