\title{Generate Penalized Spline Basis Matrix for Time Covariate}
\usage{
gen_basis_matrix(n_basis, time)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_basis}{Integer. Number of basis functions to use (number of columns in the resulting model matrix).}

\item{time}{Numeric vector. Values of the time covariate over which the basis is to be constructed.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{model_matrix}{A matrix of dimension length(time) by n_basis. The processed B-spline basis matrix.}
\item{nD}{A square matrix of dimension n_basis by n_basis. The diagonal penalty (or scaling) matrix for regularization/penalization of coefficients.}
}
}
\description{
Construct a B-spline basis matrix and associated penalty matrix for modeling a time variable,
including QR decomposition for numerical stability and
eigen-decomposition for penalty regularization.
}
\details{
Uses degree-3 B-splines with minimum degrees of freedom (df = max(4, n_basis)) including intercept. Applies QR decomposition and transformation for numerical stability. Constructs a second-order difference penalty matrix, computes its eigendecomposition, and separates fixed/random (null space/range space) spline components. The model_matrix output is standardized and aligned in row order with the input time. The penalty matrix nD can be used as a diagonal prior precision or scaling matrix for coefficient penalization.
